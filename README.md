# Bamazon-NBA-Playoffs-Edition
I've created an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL and Node, specializing in products celebrating the 2018 NBA Playoffs. 

The app takes in orders from customers, checks to see if there is enough product in stock, depletes from the store inventory, and, lastly, displays what the customer will be charged.

This application runs entirely through a computer's command line or terminal.

### 1) Initialize Node
To run the application locally, please initialize node from your terminal or command line:

`npm init`

### 2) Create the Database
Then, copy and paste the code in _bamazonSeeds.sql_ file into your favorite MySQL GUI tool.

> PC users might try [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).
> Mac users could use [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/).

This will create the MySQL database (picture the MySQL database as a big Excel spreadsheet):

`<copy & paste>bamazonSeeds.sql` then `command R`
